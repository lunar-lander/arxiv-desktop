## Development Commands

### Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make setup          # Complete setup (clean + install)
make dev            # Start full development environment
make dev-react      # Start React development server only
make build          # Build for production
make pack           # Package the app
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run linting
make info           # Show environment information
```

### Using NPM directly
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server (React + Electron)
npm run dev:react   # Start React development server only
npm run build       # Build for production
npm start           # Start Electron app (production)
npm run pack        # Package app for distribution
npm run dist        # Build and distribute app
```

### Quick Start
```bash
make setup          # First time setup
make start          # Start development (React only)
# OR
make dev            # Start full development (React + Electron)
```
